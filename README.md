# smocker-client

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/churmd/smockerclient?status.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/churmd/smockerclient)

A go client to manage [Smocker](https://smocker.dev/) servers by creating sessions, creating mocks and verifying the
usage of the mocks.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/churmd/smockerclient"
	"github.com/churmd/smockerclient/mock"
)

func main() {
	instance := smockerclient.Instance{}

	// Clear any old sessions and mocks
	err := instance.ResetAllSessionsAndMocks()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Start a new session for your new mocks
	err = instance.StartSession("SmockerClientSession")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Add a healthcheck mock
	request := mock.NewRequestBuilder(http.MethodGet, "/healthcheck").
		AddHeader("Accept", "application/json").
		Build()

	response := mock.NewResponseBuilder(http.StatusOK).AddBody(`{"status": "OK"}`).Build()
	
	mockDefinition := mock.NewDefinition(request, response)

	err = instance.AddMock(mockDefinition)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Call the healthcheck mock in the code under test
	someCodeUnderTest()

	// Verify all the mocks were used and no extra requests were made
	err = instance.VerifyMocksInCurrentSession()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Functions

-   `ResetAllSessionsAndMocks` - Clears the Smocker server of all sessions and mocks. Leaving it in a clean state.
-   `StartSession` - Starts a new session on the Smocker server with the given name. New mocks will be added to the latest
    session started.
-   `AddMock` - Adds a new mock to the current session on the Smocker server. Mocks can be made using the provided
    builders
    or raw json option detailed below.
-   `VerifyMocksInCurrentSession` - Checks all the mocks in the session have been called and that no other calls have been
    made

## Mock Definitions

### Builders

Builders for the request and response part of the mock definition are provided in the `mock` package. These allow mocks
to be setup in a more programmatic way.

```go
request := mock.NewRequestBuilder(http.MethodPut, "/foo/bar").
    AddQueryParam("limit", "10").
    AddQueryParam("filters", "red", "green").
    AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json", "application/vnd.api+json").
    AddBearerAuthToken("sv2361fr1o8ph3oin").
    AddJsonBody(`{"example": "body"`).
    Build()

response := mock.NewResponseBuilder(http.StatusOK).
    AddBody(`{"status": "OK"}`).
    AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json").
    Build()

mockDefinition := mock.NewDefinition(request, response)
```

You can also include a limit on how many times a mock can be called using the `WithCallLimit` option function.

```go
request := mock.NewRequestBuilder(http.MethodPut, "/foo/bar").
AddQueryParam("limit", "10").
AddQueryParam("filters", "red", "green").
AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json", "application/vnd.api+json").
AddBearerAuthToken("sv2361fr1o8ph3oin").
AddJsonBody(`{"example": "body"`).
Build()

response := mock.NewResponseBuilder(http.StatusOK).
AddBody(`{"status": "OK"}`).
AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json").
Build()

mockDefinition := mock.NewDefinition(request, response, mock.WithCallLimit(3))
```

### Raw Json

Not all features of the Smocker mocks have been captured in the builders and new features may be added in the future. To
help deal with these issues, a `RawJsonDefinition` also exists in the `mock` package. Json conforming to
the [Smocker Mock Definition](https://smocker.dev/technical-documentation/mock-definition.html) can be passed directly
to this, meaning more complex mocks can be created and new mock capabilities can be used immediately.

```go
mockJson := `
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/example"
    },
    "context": {
        "times": 5
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": "{\"status\": \"OK\"}"
    }
}`
mockDefinition := mock.NewRawJsonDefinition(mockJson)
```
